# Portfolio Page

This is a passion project that started before I joined tech elevator and now that I've graduated from Tech Elevator I felt like it would only be right that my first project after would be a portfolio page.

I want to try and show off what I learned over the last 4 months and hopefully learn alot more in the process.

This will be used to showcase projects I have worked on and also possibly act as a my resume and a showcase of my web development skills.
